# पुरानोThreads 🧶

Welcome to the official repository of पुरानोThreads, a passion-driven, sustainability focused eCommerce website developed as a part of our second year college project. पुरानोThreads is more than just a ecommerce website. It is a movement toward conscious fashion and an ode to everything old, redone, making ideas of sustainability practically apply.


### 𖥔 What is पुरानोThreads? 
In this modern fast fashion era, पुरानोThreads reprises the beauty of the reworked and pre-loved. We believe that old clothing should also get a second chance, not just to avoid waste, but also to share stories through threads, the stories that matter.
